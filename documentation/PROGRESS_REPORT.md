- Maintained dark mode aesthetic

## Triad Infrastructure Development
### Triad-Documents Service

- [x] Deployed service on Render
- [x] Fixed ESM compatibility issues
- [x] Created bulletproof deployment configuration

### Deployment Configuration Improvements
- Fixed module system compatibility between CommonJS and ES Modules
- Implemented proper import path handling with .js extensions
- Created bulletproof build process on Render:
  - Added postinstall script to ensure compilation
  - Added render.yaml configuration to override dashboard settings
  - Ensured TypeScript compilation happens before server start

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Complete responsiveness testing
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance
- [ ] Conduct user experience review
- [ ] Verify cross-communication between PaintBrain7 and IDEA-HUB
- [ ] Document API integration patterns between services

## Next Steps
1. Implement icon library
2. Refine responsive breakpoints
3. Conduct accessibility audit
4. Integrate Triad-Documents with PaintBrain client interface

## Design System References
See `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for comprehensive guidelines on colors, typography, and interaction states.

## TypeScript Server Performance Diagnostic Report
*Generated: 10/26/2025*

### Processes Detected

| PID   | Status | CPU    | Memory | Type                  | Notes                                     |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 83577 | R      | 167.4% | 13.7%  | tsserver (primary)    | Extremely high CPU usage, active scanning |
| 83576 | S      | 0.6%   | 0.6%   | tsserver (semantic)   | Low resource usage, normal behavior       |
| 83578 | S      | 0.0%   | 0.5%   | typingsInstaller      | Normal usage, not problematic             |

### Watched Projects

The high-CPU tsserver process is scanning multiple TypeScript projects with complex cross-project references:

1. **PaintBrain7**
   - Primary workspace with references to Triad-Documents
   - Path mappings: `@triad/*` → `../Triad-Documents/*`
   - Composite project enabled
   
2. **IDEA-HUB**
   - References Triad-Documents
   - Path mappings: `@triad/*` → `../Triad-Documents/*`
   - Composite project enabled

3. **Triad-Documents**
   - Referenced by both PaintBrain7 and IDEA-HUB

### Overlaps and Conflicts

Several configuration issues were identified that are likely causing TypeScript initialization loops:

1. **Cross-Project References**
   - Both PaintBrain7 and IDEA-HUB reference Triad-Documents using TypeScript's project references
   - Both projects have path mappings to Triad-Documents
   - VS Code is attempting to resolve and watch all these references simultaneously
   
2. **Composite Project Settings**
   - PaintBrain7 and IDEA-HUB have `"composite": true` 
   - This forces TypeScript to validate referenced projects completely
   - Creates a potential indexing loop when multiple projects reference each other

3. **Path Resolution Complexity**
   - Path mapping `@triad/*` creates complex resolution paths
   - IDE must constantly check multiple locations for imported files
   - May trigger excessive file watching and re-indexing

### Performance Impact

- TypeScript server at PID 83577 consuming over 167% CPU
- This indicates multi-threaded operation in a potentially infinite loop
- Memory usage growing over time (currently 13.7%)
- VS Code responsiveness degraded
- Constant "Initializing tsconfig.json" messages

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Project Reference Isolation**
   - Remove the `"composite": true` flag from PaintBrain7 tsconfig.json
   - This prevents aggressive validation of referenced projects
   
2. **Path Mapping Optimization**
   - Consider removing `paths` mappings that point to external projects
   - Alternatively, use explicit imports rather than aliased paths
   
3. **VS Code Workspace Configuration**
   - Create separate VS Code workspaces for each project
   - When working across projects, open only the needed ones
   
4. **Exclude Node Modules Recursively**
   - Add to each tsconfig.json:
     ```json
     "exclude": [
       "**/node_modules/**",
       "**/dist/**"
     ]
     ```
   
5. **Limit Watched Directories**
   - Add `.vscode/settings.json` with:
     ```json
     {
       "typescript.tsserver.watchOptions": {
         "watchFile": "useFsEvents",
         "watchDirectory": "useFsEvents",
         "excludeDirectories": ["**/node_modules", "**/dist"]
       }
     }
     ```

### Action Plan

1. Apply the recommended configuration changes to tsconfig.json files
2. Restart VS Code completely
3. Monitor TypeScript server processes for improved performance
4. Consider using project-specific VS Code workspaces for multi-project development

## Triad Network Validation Report
*Generated: 10/26/2025*

The cross-service connectivity test between all three Triad services has been completed.

### Network Test Results

✅ **Triad-Documents** responded in 241ms:
```json
{"message":"Server is alive"}
```

⚠️ **PaintBrain7** responded in 419ms:
```
Not Found
```

⚠️ **IDEA-HUB** responded in 232ms:
```
Not Found
```

### Connectivity Analysis

- **Triad-Documents**: The service is fully operational with proper API endpoint configuration.
- **PaintBrain7**: While the server is responding, the `/api/ping` endpoint may not be implemented.
- **IDEA-HUB**: While the server is responding, the `/api/ping` endpoint may not be implemented.

### Next Steps for Network Integration

1. Implement consistent health-check endpoints across all three services:
   - Add `/api/ping` endpoints to PaintBrain7 and IDEA-HUB
   - Standardize response format (e.g., `{"message":"Server is alive"}`)

2. Develop cross-service authentication:
   - Create shared JWT validation
   - Implement service-to-service API keys

3. Document the API interfaces for each service:
   - Define expected request/response formats
   - List all available endpoints
   - Specify error handling protocols

The successful deployment of all three services marks a significant milestone in the Triad architecture development. With proper endpoint implementation, the full cross-service communication can be established.
