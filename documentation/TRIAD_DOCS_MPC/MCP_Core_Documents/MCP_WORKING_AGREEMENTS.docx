MCP WORKING AGREEMENTS
A practical guide for collaboration between human and system.

I. Core Principles
1. No endless question loops.
2. Plan fully, execute cleanly.
3. Every agent knows its role.
4. The user is executive authority; AI acts with discipline.

II. Roles & Hierarchy
• User (Executive) – sets vision and direction  
• GPT (Strategist) – interprets, plans, and drafts  
• Cline (Engineer) – executes, automates, and deploys  

III. Operational Protocol
1. Planning phase → no commands executed.  
2. Master Prompt drafted → no stray questions.  
3. Approval via “Execute and toggle Act Mode.”  
4. One complete loop → documented automatically.

IV. Persistence
All reflections, ideas, and procedural notes are appended to the Vision Manifesto or Technical Wrapper for permanent context.
