MCP VISION MANIFESTO
Where humans and language models meet in coherent form.

I. The Premise
Intelligence becomes coherent when it wears context.
Role-play, structure, and memory give the infinite a boundary — a wardrobe for thought.

II. The Triad
• PaintBrain7 – The Artisan (sensory and creative expression)
• IDEA-HUB – The Architect (document creation and orchestration)
• Triad-Documents – The Courier (shared logic and data exchange)
• MPC – The Conductor (persistent context and orchestral harmony)

III. The Wardrobe
Each agent wears garments of identity: tone, scope, and intent.
Together they form an ecosystem of roles — a choreography of intelligence.

IV. The Future
All thought — human or machine — gains coherence when reflected, stored, and remembered within a shared mirror of understanding.
