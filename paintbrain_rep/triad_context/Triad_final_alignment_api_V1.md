# Triad Final Alignment API – V1

## Purpose
Defines the Triad's philosophy, structure, and operational model for multi-agent collaboration among GPT-5 (Architect), Cline (Executor), and a high-reasoning model such as Claude (PLAN mode). GitHub remains the shared source of truth and persistent memory.

## Core Roles
R gpt-5 (Architect): Creates alignment prompts, maintains context, ensures strategic coherence, and validates outcomes.
R kline (Executor): Executes tasks, reads/writes files, runs commands, commits/pushes to GitHub, and produces logs.
R claude (High-Reasoner / PLAN): Provides high-order reasoning to prevent tunnel vision, challenges assumptions, and proposes alternatives.

## Guiding Principles
- Alignment first: ‘aeasure twice, cut once.’
- GitHub as the shared memory and verification layer (ideas/, triad_governance/, logs/).
- Each mission has a dedicated alignment file and short, iterative tickets.
- PLAN mode uses Claude (deep reasoning); ACT mode executes via GPT-5 + Cline.
- Keep prompts self-contained; minimize follow-ups; log everything concisely.

## Phase III-H Goal
Establish a secure relay for autonomous Claude © GPT-5 exchanges via OpenRouter (or equivalent), while preserving GitHub as the auditable reasoning bus. Until then, operate in hybrid/manual mode with PLAN/ACT model switching and logged tickets.

## Ticket Loop (REP-style)
1) User states intent
2) GPT-5 translates to parameters
3) Cline executes & logs
4)GPT-5 verifies & records
(optional) Claude reviews for blind spots and refinements.
