## ðŸ“˜ TRIAD STATUS SNAPSHOT LOG
**File:** governance/logs/triad_status_snapshot.md  
**Timestamp:** Mon Oct 27 2025 â€” Context Consolidation Complete  

### Current Phase  
**Phase III-G.5 â€” Governance Alignment Integration**  
Status: âœ… Complete  
Next Authorized Phase: **Phase III-H â€” Distributed Reasoning Layer (Concept Alignment Checkpoint Pending)**  

### System Overview  
| Layer | Function | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Iâ€“III (Aâ€“C) | Context Hub + Synchronization | âœ… Stable |
| III-D | Governance-Aware Sync | âœ… Active |
| III-E | Co-operative Intelligence Layer | âœ… Operational |
| III-F | Emergent Workflow Orchestration | âœ… Operational |
| III-G | Learning & Optimization | âœ… Active |
| III-G.5 | Governance Alignment Template Integration | âœ… Complete |
| Consolidation Period | Context Map & Dependency Graph Rebuilt | âœ… Verified |

### Governance Framework  
- Three-checkpoint alignment protocol (Concept â†’ Architecture â†’ Pre-Toggle) formalized.  
- Roles locked: **Atrain / A-Frame (Strategist)**, **GPT-5 (Architect)**, **Cline (Executor)**.  
- All governance assets indexed, cross-referenced, and verified.  
- System equilibrium confirmed â€” no pending exceptions.

### Next Steps  
1. Initialize **Phase III-H â€“ Distributed Reasoning Layer**  
   - Purpose: enable multi-agent reasoning across Triad services.  
   - Begin with Concept Alignment Checkpoint #1.  
2. Implement shared GitHub repo for persistent Triad context.  
3. Transition manual paste â†’ automated context loading via gateway or API bridge.

### Resume Protocol (for new GPT sessions)
