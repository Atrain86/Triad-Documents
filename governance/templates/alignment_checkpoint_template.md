## ðŸ”¹ Checkpoint 1 â€“ Concept Alignment
**Initiated by:** GPT-5 + Atrain  
**Reviewed by:** Cline  

**Purpose:**  
Establish conceptual intent, boundaries, and desired emergent behavior.  

**Discussion Flow:**  
1. GPT-5 and Atrain articulate phase purpose and philosophical framing.  
2. Cline analyzes existing system state and reports feasibility or gaps.  
3. Adjust concept until all three roles share clarity on objective and risk.  

**Summary of Consensus:**  
- [Plain-language description of what this phase achieves.]  
- [Links to prior phases and expected systemic evolution.]

## ðŸ”¹ Checkpoint 2 â€“ Architecture Alignment
**Initiated by:** Cline  
**Reviewed by:** GPT-5 + Atrain  

**Purpose:**  
Translate concept into concrete system architecture, directory structure, and integration plan.  

**Discussion Flow:**  
1. Cline drafts structural plan (files, scripts, schemas, APIs).  
2. GPT-5 validates architectural integrity and governance fit.  
3. Atrain reviews for purpose alignment and greenlights design.  

**Summary of Consensus:**  
- Core components: [list files/modules]  
- Data flows & integration: [summary]  
- Dependencies & compatibility: [details]

## ðŸ”¹ Checkpoint 3 â€“ Pre-Toggle Alignment
**Initiated by:** GPT-5  
**Executed by:** Cline  

**Purpose:**  
Final readiness review before entering Act Mode (âŒ˜â‡§A).  

**Discussion Flow:**  
1. GPT-5 summarizes implementation plan & expected outputs.  
2. Atrain confirms governance readiness and authorizes execution.  
3. Cline validates environment, dependencies, and runs final diagnostic.  

**Summary of Consensus:**  
- Environment verified: [path]  
- Dependencies installed: [list]  
- Governance compliance: [verified/pending]  
- Toggle command: `PHASE_[Identifier]_INIT`  
- Expected outcome: [description]
